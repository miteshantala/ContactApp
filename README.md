# ContactApp
-Download the ContactApp.zip and extract to local machine
-Open the solution in VS 2015
-Install/Build all the packages(automatic from package config file)

Following technologies are used:
ASP.NET MVC,
ASP.NET WEB API,
AngularJS,
SQL Server (File)

Featurs: 
->3 tier architecture, so Business and Database can REUSE with different UI/App eg. windows or WCF etc.
->Error and message log (Fectory pattern) can log the error and message in Database or File system (config setting not implemeted).
->Database can easyly replace, not need to modify Business classes

 
Note:
For time being I have not implemented login functionality, UI Error handling, Popup for edit contact, I could have use bootstrap for responsive UI.
